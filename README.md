This application displays a list of US cat related patents (dummy data) and reads/writes to a corresponding XML file. It builds on a previous assignment (https://github.com/whitneyhaddow/cat-patents) but uses a sorted list and allows searching by key and updating previous records.

(This application was created fas an assignment for a class I was taking.)
